# RESOURCE LIBRARY
Our resource section is a staff-managed collection of tools, programs, websites, tutorials, etc. to facilitate coding and learning.

# ABOUT THE LIBRARY

Please look through and use whatever you want, and if you have a suggestion for something we don't have listed, send us a message in contact-staff within the Coding Camp discord. 

coding-tools — the various websites and things we use or recommend for coding, including live editors and tutorials

design-tools — websites and things we use or recommend to enhance coding (e.g., font icons, texture sites, free image sites, etc.) * 

communities — Jcink sites or servers you can join to connect with other Jcink creators. While we've listed a bunch of resources in the above channels, these communities have even more, especially in terms of specific scripts, coding snippets, and tutorials. 

(Note about Jcink-specific tutorials: We don't want to list every single one that exists, but we'll consider highly requested ones as we go — kind of like an FAQ.) 

* Please always read the usage rights. Many resources shared are free for personal use unless otherwise stated (e.g., Adobe Fonts requires a subscription, which I've called out). But sites can specify different requirements for different types of use, and even "free" sometimes comes with limitations, so please always read and double check before using an image, font, icon pack, texture, etc., especially for something you want to sell.

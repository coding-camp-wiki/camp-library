# CAMP LIBRARY
Our resource section is a staff-managed collection of tools, programs, websites, tutorials, etc. to facilitate coding and learning.

# ABOUT THE LIBRARY

Please look through and use whatever you want, and if you have a suggestion for something we don't have listed, send us a message in contact-staff within the Coding Camp discord. 

### Coding Title Here 
The various websites and things we use or recommend for coding, including live editors and tutorials

### Design Title Here
Websites and things we use or recommend to enhance coding (e.g., font icons, texture sites, free image sites, etc.) * 

### Communities 
Jcink sites or servers you can join to connect with other Jcink creators. While we've listed a bunch of resources in the above catagories, these communities have even more, especially in terms of specific scripts, coding snippets, and tutorials. 

(Note about Jcink-specific tutorials: We don't want to list every single one that exists, but we'll consider highly requested ones as we go â€” kind of like an FAQ.) 

* **Please always read the usage rights.** Many resources shared are free for personal use unless otherwise stated (e.g., Adobe Fonts requires a subscription, which I've called out). But sites can specify different requirements for different types of use, and even "free" sometimes comes with limitations, so please always read and double check before using an image, font, icon pack, texture, etc., especially for something you want to sell.

# JCINK FEATURE UPDATES
While **we'll primarily use resource-updates to let you know about changes to the Camp Library**, that channel will also be used to (non-ping) announce new Jcink features and bug fixes. 

For this secondary purpose, we're especially interested in hidden updates. Sometimes little things are enabled or fixed or created, and we find out through word of mouth because they aren't officially announced on Jcink's support forum, only revealed in topic replies. This channel can help us spread the information a little bit further.  An example:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Topic Starter Group ID and Last Replier Group ID variables enabled in topic rows 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (https://forum.jcink.com/index.php?showtopic=35075&st=0&#entry237804)

Features and fixes should be official, meaning from the Jcink team themselves, usually found somewhere on the support forum, not always in the official documentation. We will not be announcing workarounds or scripts supplied by the awesome people who help out on the support forum.

This will be heavily based on contributions from everyone, so please let us know if you see something. Please drop us the link in contact-staff and we'll check it out. 

As this is a running updates channel, we will not be adding Jcink updates retroactively before July 1st, but anything from then on is fair game!
